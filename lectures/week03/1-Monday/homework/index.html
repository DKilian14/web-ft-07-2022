<h1> This is a website made with only h tags!</h1>

<h4>Like that Jeremy guy, for example</h4>
<h5>I mean, like what is his deal</h5>
<h6>Why does he drink so much Coke Zero? Weird.</h6>

<p>Here's what I like about lists:</p>
<ul>
    <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
    <li>That's about it</li>
    <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
</ul>
<p>When you make a list, do it in this order:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not. </li>
    <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
    <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items
        <ul>
            <li>Curveball! you can nest lists inside eachother</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
</ol>
